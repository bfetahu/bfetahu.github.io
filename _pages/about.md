## Research Interests

My research focuses on bridging the gap between unstructured and structured data, with focus on IR and IE techniques applying to both structured and unstructured data. You can find my publications here. I am broadly interested in: 

* Natural Language Processing
* Information Retrieval
* Information Extraction
* Entity Search
* Text Mining
* Semantic Web

## PhD Thesis

I defended my thesis in November, 2017. The thesis was evaluated with the highest grade (summa cum laude) by all three members of the evaluation comittee (Prof. Dr. techn. Wolfgang Nejdl, Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke, Prof. Dr. Ing. Bodo Rosenhahn). The electronic copy of my thesis can be accessed here, and the slide deck of my presentation is accessible here. 

In my PhD studies and my thesis, I worked on automated approaches for enriching and improving textual knowledge bases. The primary focus was on Wikipedia, where I tackled several problems and challenges, which dealt mostly with the Verifiability principle of Wikipedia. In detail, the main components of the proposed approaches in my thesis were the following:

* Finding citations for Wikipedia statements
* Determining the span of existing citations in Wikipedia
* Suggesting missing and novel information for Wikipedia pages
